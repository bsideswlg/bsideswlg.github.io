<p><strong>Call For Papers (CFP) is now closed</strong></p>

<p>In true Security B-Sides (BSides) form, BSides Wellington is a community security conference. What better way to pay tribute to that community than inviting consultants, hackers, hobbyists, academics, students, and public-sector type folks to a conference hall to share their ideas, experiences and knowledge?</p>

<p>All submissions will be reviewed by our CFP review board. We will be accepting talks in 2 rounds. So, if you have something to say, submit your talk now because the second round will be a little less flexible in terms of time/format/topics.</p>

<h1 id="length">Length</h1>

<p>When you submit, you can decide on your talk length. We are happy to support anything from a 10-minute lightning talk through to a 60-minute demonstration or talk. In addition to this, we are also interested in submissions for 60-minute to 3-hour workshops.</p>

<h1 id="diversity-and-inclusivity">Diversity and Inclusivity</h1>

<p>We are committed to promoting diversity and inclusivity in the security community. We are particularly keen to receive submissions from women, LGBTQI, people of colour, younger, older, financially less resourced, and other groups who are underrepresented in the security and wider tech industry. We believe that information security outcomes are significantly improved when we are inclusive and listen to the ideas, experiences and knowledge from as diverse group of people as possible.</p>

<p>If you are a representative of such a group and need financial assistance to present at BSides Wellington then please let us know.</p>

<h1 id="mentoring">Mentoring</h1>

<p>Is this your first time speaking? Are you thinking of giving a talk? Or maybe you want a bit of feedback on your presentation? Are you not sure if your idea would make a good presentation? or do you just have a question?</p>

<p>Then reach out to us at info@bsides.nz and we will try to pair you up with a mentor to help form your idea or submission and polish your presentation with more cat gifs (please note talks advocating for soft “g” in the pronunciation of gif will not be accepted).</p>

<h1 id="tips-for-submitting-a-successful-cfp">Tips for Submitting a Successful CFP</h1>

<p>Following these tips will help us understand why we should select your presentation for BSides Wellington 2017.</p>

<ul>
<li>Give your proposal a simple and straightforward title.</li>
<li>Ensure that your talk is authentic, your peers will want original ideas, real-world scenarios, relevant examples or to learn something cool.</li>
<li>Include as much detail about the presentation as possible.</li>
<li>Explain why people will want to attend your talk and what they’ll take away from it.</li>
<li>Keep your proposal free of marketing, sales, buzzwords, jargon and Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD).</li>
<li>Limit the scope of your talk and ensure that you cover the interesting idea, concept, technique or finding in the presentation time you have selected.</li>
<li>If you only have enough material to present for 30 minutes, please don’t propose a 60-minute talk and then stretch your material to fill time.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are not accepting any vendor pitches or corporate cheerleading talks. You are welcome to talk briefly about what your company does, or use corporate slides. However, your talk must focus on sharing your ideas, experience and knowledge with the community, and not selling products and services.</p>

<p>Our code of conduct applies to all speakers, and we will not hesitate to blast “Flight of the Bumblebee” and usher you off stage if necessary.
If you made it this far through reading, go ahead and submit!</p>
